Source code for ScanCode pre-built dependencies

ScanCode contains third-party dependencies that are pre-built and vendored.
This helps having a self contained archived that works as-is on checkout or 
download and require minimal configuration.

The corresponding source code (and build instructions when these diverge from
the default) are stored here.
